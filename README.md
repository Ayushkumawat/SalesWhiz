# Business Challenge & Opportunity
In today's fast-paced business landscape, traditional IVR systems lead to customer frustration and lost sales opportunities. The challenge lies in delivering personalized and efficient customer interactions. SalesWhiz seizes the opportunity to revolutionize this experience by combining AI technology with sales expertise, addressing pain points and unlocking new revenue streams.

# Rationale for Generative AI
Generative AI offers a solution that bridges the gap between IVR systems and human interactions. It can understand customer queries in natural language, provide contextually relevant responses, and even generate real-time voice outputs. This human-like interaction drives engagement, meeting the modern customer's demands for personalized and efficient service.

# Proposed Generative AI Solution
SalesWhiz employs OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model to power human-like conversations. Users engage through speech, which is transcribed and processed by the AI. Responses are generated based on conversation history, incorporating context and tailoring recommendations. The AI can understand user intent, recommend products, and perform tasks like scheduling appointments. Google Text-to-Speech converts responses into audio for an authentic experience.

Solution Architecture: User Speech Input -> Speech-to-Text -> AI Conversation (GPT-3.5 Turbo) -> Text-to-Speech -> Audio Output
